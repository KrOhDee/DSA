# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository

This repository contains my implementations and solutions for various Data Structures and Algorithms concepts, as well as practice problems from platforms like LeetCode. The goal of this repository is to enhance my understanding of DSA and improve problem-solving skills.

## Data Structures

I'll be focusing on learning about these data structures, which are crucial for organizing and storing data efficiently:

- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree)
- Graph
- Hash Table
- Heap

## Algorithms

I intend to cover these various algorithms that are essential in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion and Backtracking
